\subsection*{A man (50 years old)}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Do you order takeaway food?}

Yes, sometimes I do.

I find it really convenient because I can place my orders directly from home.

Placing an order with the app is safer because people can make errors when taking orders (e.g. wrong topping). Using the app reduces the number of misunderstandings.

Yes, I think I would do it for the same reasons of using an app.

\subsection*{A female (24 years old)}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Do you order takeaway food?}

Yes. I do it at least once a week

\item \textbf{What are the reasons why you do / don't do so?}

I like to order takeaway food because it's convenient when I don't want or I can't cook. It's useful also when I want to eat a particular type of food while being at home

I usually order on mobile delivery apps and less frequently on sites of takeaway service

\subsection*{A female (20 years old)}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Do you order takeaway food?}

Yes

\item \textbf{What are the reasons why you do / don't do so?}

It's more convenient due to my university hours; I'm an off-campus student so in this way I don't need to cook or wash dishes. Moreover it's useful when I want to eat something different from what I usually prepare at home

\item \textbf{How do you usually place food orders?}

I usually order on mobile delivery apps. I rarely take personally my food at the restaurant

\item \textbf{What are the pros and cons about this approach in your opinion?}

It's the most convenient method and I have all the time I need to select the food. On the other hand I can't talk directly with the restaurant in the case in which I need to modify a specific plate. Moreover prices are often higher and If there are many of us ordering, it is difficult to divide the total cost

\item \textbf{Would you use a voice chatbot to order takeaway? Why?}

Of course. It would be like ordering at the restaurant if a voice chatbot interacts with the customer. I think that this could resolve the lack of communication that I find in the mobile apps.

\subsection*{A male (20 years old)}

\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{Do you order takeaway food?}

Yes

\item \textbf{What are the reasons why you do / don't do so?}

I think that it's a faster process rather than going physically to the restaurant. Sometimes I don't want to go out, so it's very convenient.

I use mobile apps like Glovo, JustEat and so on

\item \textbf{What are the pros and cons about this approach in your opinion?}

I feel more confident about the correctness of my order with a mobile app, I think there's a less chance of making mistakes. On the other hand I experienced some bugs with some mobile apps in the payment section in multiple occasions. Even though I had chosen the option to pay with cash, the app used the option "Pay by credit card"

\item \textbf{Would you use a voice chatbot to order takeaway? Why?}

No because I used voice chatbots a lot of times and very often they didn't completely understand what I said

\end{enumerate}
