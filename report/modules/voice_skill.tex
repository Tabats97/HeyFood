\section{Voice skill}
The end goal of the project was to develop a working voice chatbot.
We decided to implement it as an Alexa skill. We took the interaction
model designed during prototyping and brought it to life. The skill
allows the user to make an order by selecting pizzas and amounts for
every selection. It offers ways to recap an order and make
confirmations/declinations.
