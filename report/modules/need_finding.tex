\section{Need finding}
We have made an analysis of the possible scenarios in which this kind
of system could be useful. Thus, we have thought about a few needs
that users could have:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Obtaining information and suggestions about restaurants in the area.
    \item Placing an order to a given restaurant. 
    \item Rate an order.
\end{itemize}
