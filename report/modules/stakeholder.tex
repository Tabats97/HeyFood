\section{Stakeholder interview}

As for standard users that want to order food, it is important to understand the needs and points of view expressed by the other stakeholders of the system. In this case we interviewed the owner of a pizza restaurant, who started a takeaway and home delivery service during the pandemic crisis. 
We asked him for a personal opinion on the system we aim to deploy according to the logic of his business. This allow us to follow a design pattern that is not only user centered respect the interaction but also driven by the business needs.


\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{What are your ordering channels for the takeaway?
What is the sales volume generated by each of them in proportion?}

I offer my customers different methods to order in my restaurant: by phone, through my website, through the generic delivery apps, and through social networks and in particular Whatsapp business. Maybe, on average 50\% of the orders are taken by phone, 30\% via generic apps, 10\% through our website, and the remaining through social media.

\item \textbf{How do you choose your restaurant sales channels? How important is it in your opinion to have multiple ordering methods?}

I choose the sales methods mainly based on the visibility that the method offers to my restaurant with respect to potential customers, and then I also look at the price I have to pay to use it of course. Have more sales channels is important to reach a larger customer population.

\item \textbf{Would it be interesting in your opinion to develop a voice chat software based on artificial intelligence that allows the customer to order pizza or something else?}

I think so, now people tend to use the smartphone and apps more and more, and the percentage of the calls are decreasing. It can also be an idea that can be specially advertised and can give a modern and advanced image of the restaurant that adopt it.  

\item \textbf{In your opinion, what is the valuable feature that you consider more important for this system for the goals of your business?}

The most important thing for me is that the robot is as human as possible, or rather he knows the menu and knows how to explain our dishes to customers. The coolest feature would be if it acted like a virtual waiter, trying to sell more than what customers ask for themselves.
