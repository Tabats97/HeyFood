\section{Our goal}

Our initial idea is to build a voice service that enables the user
to order takeaway food from a specific restaurant.
The system should have the following functionalities:

\begin{itemize}
    
    \item The system should act as a waiter.
    \item The system guides the user step by step in the order placement process.
    \item The system recaps, modifies and deletes the order when the user asks for it.
    \item The system gives information about the menu available when the user asks for something that's not present in it.

\end{itemize}
